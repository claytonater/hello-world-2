# hello-world-2

Hello future self. I hope you have found a good paying job (preferably coding) and have found love and happiness. Also I hope you are #1 on osu by the time you read this. I am just picturing you going through the many other projects that you have made on here and then look at this one and be inspired by how far you've come. Oh and don't be living with your parents still, that would be lame. 

Edit: Also, also keep working on your late-night practices. Time and effort is the only way to master it. Good luck.
